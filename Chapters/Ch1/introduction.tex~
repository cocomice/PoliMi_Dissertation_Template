\section{Motivation}\label{sec:intro_motivation}

From ancient Mesopotamia culture to Chinese Yellow River civilization, since
the emergence of human society along the river catchments, water has been
playing a critical role in supporting the development of human civilization.
On the other hand, the natural variability of water resource directly or
indirectly related to many disastrous natural hazards, 
stimulating humans' adaptive nature \citep{potts1996evolution}, and leading us
to try to understand the hydrological cycle and to manage the water resource for the prosperity of human
welfare. A history of water management might as well be a history of mankind's
socialization process.

The efforts spent in learning and managing water are never halted, but are
continuously amplified thanks to the innovations of modern technologies and the
accumulation of scientific wisdom. Stepping into 21st century human beings
are in the new era with enormous capacity in modifying, managing and
regulating the water systems, with countless engineering artifacts
unequivocally showing the power of mankind. A tip of those examples are, for
instance, the Three Gorges Dam featuring a total electric power generating
capacity of 22,500 MW, the Ras Al Khair desalination plant that is able to
produce 1,025,000 $m^3$ water per day (in 2014), and the stormwater drainage
systems in modern cities for diverting runoff water and reducing flood risk in
the cities. In fact, the water system and human society have been twisted
together for quite a history, forming an intimate relationship. On one hand,
the use of water resource is not anymore limited to watering crops in
agricultural sectors, but extends into hydro-power generation, industrial
production and the urban lifestyle. In other word, water has penetrated into
every angle of modern human life and the availability (or unavailability) of
water will manifest greater impact on our strategies of survival and
well-being. On the other hand, the day-to-day activities within the human society
are equally impacting the water body in terms of both quantity as well as the
quality. For example, the return flow of urban waste water into lake body may
alter the nitrification process, causing eutrophication problem.
The water release from reservoir operation may change the temperature of river
downstream, impacting the river ecosystem as well as that alongside.

Given the close bond and direct feedback between water system and human
society, it makes an intuitive attempt to treat the human entities as endogenous components
within the water system where the society resides and interacts with, rather
than exogenous forcing that only unilaterally impacting the water body. Many
theoretical studies have already suggested such holistic view on the human and
water system \citep[e.g.,][]{Falkenmark1998,Wagener2010,Sivapalan2012}.
Moreover, the dynamic mutual interaction implies the two systems are
interconnected and co-evolve in time. Particularly, the evolution of natural
water system with evident human footprints are resulting from not only the
natural environmental process but also the anthropogenic activities, where latter
is rivaling with former with deepening and widening influence
\citep[e.g.,][]{Liu2014,nilsson2005fragmentation,ma2008analysis,
wang2007stepwise}. Under the climate change context with increasing
temperature in the near future \citep{pachauri2007contribution}, the
co-evolution of human-water systems are expected to take place at more rapid
pace and the feedback mechanism will further reinforce such process,
specially if the societies of mankind are reacting to the changing
environment with aggressive adaptation and migration strategies.

%   Therefore, the human entities with regard to the water resource system is no
%   more the exogenous forcing that unilaterally impacting the water body, but
%   rather an endogenous component within that system where feedback between human
%   society and water system occurs ergodically.
%   \item In addition, the bond between the water system and human society implies
%   that the boundary of water system is not limited by its physical boarders but
%   rather by its societal influence, which may include the downstream basin, such
%   as farmland area or even cross the countries if the river is trans-border. The
%   involvement of multiple sectors whose interests differ from one to the other
%   will further complicates the water system, where human footprint may show
%   increasing dominance.

Therefore, it is far less clear than before about how the human-water
system will evolve into the future, and traditional methodologies in studying
the water problems need to be ruminated and overhauled on their applicability
for embracing the new challenges. Yet, reviewing the literature it can be
noticed that most techniques in analyzing water system are assuming the
stationary boundary conditions, e.g., rainfall or stream flow, meaning that
the statistical finger prints of those driving forces from historical
observations will remain the same in the future.
Mathematical models built on such assumption usually consider only the subset
of human-water systems in the analysis, namely the physical environment or
societal sector (e.g., water demand sector or/and supply sector), leaving the
rest as exogenous drivers in presumed scenarios
\citep[e.g.,][]{vorosmarty2000global, rosenzweig2004water, gordon2005human,
medellin2008adaptability}. In these cases, the feedback between the natural and
human system is either ignored or simplified. Although for quite a time we have been greatly benefited from the
stationarity assumption and succeeded in managing the water
systems confronting of many potential risks, it is not clear
about how much gain one can withhold from the traditional approaches as the
climate change continues to unfold its multi-dimensional affects on
planetary scale. 

Stationarity is fading \citep{milly2007stationarity}, as is both
expected in future and observed in recent decades, and human is becoming the
principle drivers of environmental process. There is an increasing need to
bring the human players back to the paradigm of water system analysis,
justifying their roles as both stakeholders in water resource management but
also as the active endogenous drivers that dynamically shaping the structure of
the water system physically and politically.
New approaches have to attach to the holistic view of the water system, treat
the human sectors and natural systems as integrity and explicitly account for
human activities as the internal components. The effort for achieving this
methodologically is twofold. First, system modeling frameworks have to find
ways to glue the anthropogenic sphere with the hydrological systems such that
the feedback between the human activities and hydrological cycles can be
addressed internally. Thanks to the advance of computer technology and
information science, there are now a number of ways to accomplish this task
via, e.g., agent based modeling framework (ABM, see \citep{ferber1999multi}),
in which each agent represents an active decision-maker who lives on the common
environment and interacts within. A few examples of applications of
agent-based modeling in water systems can be found in, e.g., \cite{Ng2011},
\cite{Barthel2008}, \cite{Becu2003}, \cite{giuliani2013assessing}, and a
comprehensive discussions about utility of agent-based modeling in water
resource management can be found in \cite{giuliani2014agent}. It is worth to
mention that with agent based framework, not only the feedback between agents
and physical environment can be modeled but also the social network can be
represented through agents interactions. Secondly, human as an autonomous 
self-organizing agents, their behavior are influenced by many factors
(e.g., personal belief, monetary constraint, others' opinions) and hence are
characterised by high non-linearity and uncertainties. Modeling humans'
behaviors as simple rule-based cellular automate may not be sufficient to
capture the interesting phenomenons or even drive the simulation into astray.
Advanced behavioral models have to be implemented or consulted from other
disciplinary, such as cognition science or decision-making theory. However,
to the author's best knowledge there are only a small number of literature
studying behavioral models for water resource management
\citep[e.g][]{hamilton1983saving,lam1999predicting,yazdanpanah2014understanding},
and the combined use with agent-based framework is even fewer. Therefore, how
to model the humans' behaviors and incorporate them into the large picture of
system model in a flexible and meaningful way represents the major challenge
in approaching the holistic view of modern human-water system analysis. 

%   This is not a trivial task, however, as the human behavior is far more complex
%   and hence difficult to predict. The existence of multiple heterogeneous individuals and the
%   interactions amongst further complicate such task. On the bright side, there
%   are enumorous studies from psychology and behavioral economics disciplines
%   trying to identify the pattern of human behavior. What is more encouraging is
%   that there are now also many studies in the water resource management which
%   explicitly model the decision-makers behaviors as part of coupled
%   human-natural system (CHNS) (cite) using, e.g. multi-agent system.
%   Under the climate change context, the projected change in the societal domain
%   is no less strong as the change of hydro-climatic conditions.
%   Adaptation is expected to take place more frequently and more intensely, which
%   implies greater impact from human activities and also casting the potential
%   risk from it if the feedback in between is not understand adequately,
%   analogous to the ignorance of feedback between the human activities and global
%   warming phenomenon at very beginning.

%   \item In CHNS, the active stakeholders are no less important than the
%   authoritative decision-maker, which is different from the traditional
%   centralized approach as advocated by the classic Operational Research and
%   System Control discipline, in which one decision-maker is usually assumed and
%   the objective is to find the solution in order to optimize the system-wide
%   performance.
This Ph.D dissertation contributes a novel decision-analytic framework
by constructing the coupled human and natural system (CHNS, see
\cite{liu2007coupled}) with agent based models by explicitly describing the processes of 
human decision-making as impacting on the natural process, and the feedbacks of these latter on humans' sectors.  

In the following sections, a brief discussion about the progress of CHNS
and human behavioral models will be given in order help readers develop the
main context of the present thesis. The author will use `human entity' or a
particular occupation, e.g., farmers or water regulator, to refer to an
individual mankind, while use `agent' instead for more general cases in which
agent could be of higher abstraction, such as group of humans or organizations.
Moreover, if is not specifically pointed out, the world `decision-making' will
be equivalent to the meaning of `behavior' (or action) in this case, as the
emphasis of behavioral models in the dissertation is on the decisions through
which agents interact with the environment. This idea is in contrary to many
cognitive studies where the focus is on the mental states or intentions of the human entity.

% \item In general, one tends to overhaul system under
%   different scenarios, and then use, e.g. sensitivity analysis (SA),
%   optimization algorithm to improve the system's performance correspondingly. In
%   such as way the model can be used as a decision-supporting tool to
%   inform decision-makers in

\section{Coupled human and natural systems (CHNS) model}\label{sec:intro_CHNS}

Interactions between human and nature have long been recognized
\citep[e.g.,][]{marsh1965man,thomas1956man,turner1988earth,heichelheim1956man,
falkenmark1977water,redman1999human}, and during the development of natural
science there were visionaries who proactively suggested holistic perspective on
the partnership between the human and natural systems from time to time
\citep[e.g.,][]{holling1978adaptive,redman1999human,vitousek1997human,kates1999our}.
Regardless of the voice from those advocates, few studies are really practicing such idea in
developing their methodologies. This might partly be due to the intrinsic
complexity of either natural system or human system that already poses a
number of unsolved questions for academia community, let alone their
interactions which are even more complicated. In addition, human activities
might not be as pervasive as they are now and hence their impacts on the
natural system are arguably small to produce profound affects. Dually the
potential risk from environment hazards, e.g., flood or drought events, were
still manageable through engineering approaches for sufficiently long time,
given the stationarity assumption of natural variability.

To date we are in a critical period in which individual humans are
weaved into a gigantic web due to the globalization (a cite?), and the affects
of anthropogenic activities, particularly the industrial productions, have
cumulatively manifesting profound impacts on the earth. Global warming
phenomenon, in particular, has been reported to feature a strong human footprint in
the trend (see figure \ref{fig:global_warming}, \citep{IPCC2007}). The
projected future climate shows an increase of at least around 2 degree
by the end of this century \citep{stocker2013ipcc}, and the changed climate will
alter the statistical distributions of many hydro-climatic variables,
accompanied with more extreme events and ultimately weaken the
stationarity assumption. More concerns on conventional decoupled analysis of
human/natural systems are arising under such climate change context, which
informs current interests in CHNS models.

CHNS are not merely alignments of human and natural systems, but rather
an integrated system in which humans interact with the environment. The focus
of CHNS lies on studying the patterns and processes that link human and
natural systems, and the reciprocal feedback between the two across spatial
and temporal scales \citep{liu2007coupled}. The term `coupling' implies the
interlacing of the two subsystems at lower level, which can be conceptualized
as the entities with nested hierarchies \citep{gunderson2001panarchy}. The dynamic
feedback loops in the coupled system will either accelerate or hinder the rate of
changes of the components in the human or natural systems, producing
unexpected consequences or anticipated results but at a more rapid pace
\citep[e.g.][]{Liu2007,steffen2006global}, which might be underestimated with
traditional approaches.

Although the idea of CHNS is not completely new (e.g., the Integrated
Water Resources Management (IWRM), e.g., \cite{fang2007management},
\cite{jonch2001firming}, \cite{van2005integrated}, \cite{medema2008premise},
\cite{mitchell2005integrated}), this time it quickly sparked many
relevant research activities.
In the hydrological domain topics such as socio-hydrology
\citep{Sivapalan2012}, water diplomacy \citep{islam2012water} and the Panta
Rhei \citep{montanari2013panta} project are actively pushing the applications of
CHNS and advance the understandings of human and natural interactions. By and
large, most of the works in coupling human and natural systems take two paths,
i.e., a conceptual lumped model where differential equations are used to
represent stylized parsimonious coupled systems with human-nature interactions
incorporated as internal parameters, whose values will change as the
interactions go on \citep[e.g.][]{liu2015conceptual,van2014socio}, or
agent-based models in which the anthropogenic elements are modeled as
distributed individual agents acting within a common environment
\citep[e.g.,][]{Ralha2013,Ducrot2004a,vanOel2010}.
Despite the simplistic form of the lumped models, agent-based models are
generally more flexible for constructing CNHS due to their abilities of
representing the heterogeneity of human entities and to explore the
decentralized solutions. 
Moreover, not only the human-nature feedbacks but also the social interactions
can be modeled within agent-based framework, therefore a more realistic
panorama of CHNS can be sketched.

Nevertheless, applications of ABM framework for human-natural systems,
particularly hydrological systems, are still in their infancy. First,
constructing the ABM for CHNS models requires substantial parameters to be
defined and calibrated in order to represent a fully distributed heterogeneous
environment, including the human sphere \citep{Bazghandi2012}. Secondly, because
ABM is intrinsically composed by a number of modules (e.g., agent models,
environmental layers), leading to the highly non-linear dynamics of model
behavior, it is not easy to understand the results nor to validate them
\citep{ligtenberg2010validation}.

Last but not the least, it is still not clear enough about how humans behave and
interact with the environment, even for some specific decisions, e.g., farmers'
crop choices. New techniques and multi-disciplinary efforts are needed to
advance the ABM framework. More details about the modeling approach for agents'
behaviors will be provided in the following section.

% Mathematical models is useful to represent a real system with necessary
% simplification, for helping researchers to infer system behavior from
% assumptions and for decision support, and hence is popularly used by many water
% system scientists. However, traditional paradigm of water system studies usually
% preclude the human components from the water system model, treating it as
% exogenous drivers whose impact will is only unilaterally posed on the hydrologic
% system. Dually, the influence from modification of hydrologic regime on human
% system is done in similar way, by assuming different scenarios of hydrologicalr
% boundary conditions and feeding it into socio-economic models. Although
% theoretical work that stressing the importance of endogenous view of human
% components never stop voicing, attempts in modelling either one are still
% undertaken in a decoupled way or/and in separate disciplines and empirical
% studies with an integrated setting are lacking. Particularly research about
% human system is commonly studies in socio-economic domain.
% 
% On the macro scale, foci usually are given on the strutuctural change of the
% societal system due to the coevolution of cultural, economical, technological,
% institutional as well as the ecological development at different scales under
% external strees. Models are useful to experiment and explore the possible
% outcomes of complex social system in a explicit, clear and systematic way, and
% help to gain better understanding of the real system dynamic or/and causal
% relationship.
% Agent-based models from distributed artificial intellengice discipline are
% frequently adopted in those studies, in which each agent represents a individual
% or aggregated decision-maker(s). The behavioral rules of agents are usually of
% simplistic form, e.g. if-else rules, while agents can interact with each other
% similar to the social interaction. The heterogeneous behavior of agents and
% social interaction allows the emergence of systematic phenomenon from such
% micro-scale behavioral patterns. Advance of information system techonolgy
% nowadays enable the simulation of very large scale social system with thousands
% of agents involved. However, due to the simplification of agent behavior the
% agent-based models are usually used to describe the possible scenarios given the
% assumptions rather than to predict the outcome. Moreover, due to the complexity
% of agent models it is also difficult to validate the model against the
% observations.
% 
% Studies on micro scale tends to be more specifc, focusing on small group or
% individual decision-maker.
% 
% 
% Coupling human and hydrologic system is concerned with developing mathematical
% models to understand how the hydrological system and human society change over
% time due to feedbacks with each other under changing conditions, particularly
% under climate change context. However, despite the intimate relationship between
% the human society and the natural system, attempts in modelling either one are
% usually undertaken in a decoupled way or/and in separate disciplines,
% particularly research about human system is commonly studied in socio-economic
% or physiological domains. On a mirco scale, studies on individual behavior is
% xxx. On the macro scale, simulations of societal process usually adopt the
% agent-based models from artificial intellengice discipline, in which each agent
% represents a individual or aggregated decision-maker(s). The behavioral rules of
% agents are usually of simplistic form, e.g. if-else rules, while agents can
% interact with each other similar to the social interaction. The heteorogenous
% behavior of agents and social interaction allows the emergence of systematic
% phenomenon from such micro-scale behavioral patterns. Advance of information
% system techonolgy nowadays enable the simualtion of very large scale social
% system with thousands of agents invovled. However, due to the simplificaiton of
% agent behavior the agent-based models are usually used to describe the possible
% scenarios given the assumptions rather than to prdict the outcome. Moreover, due
% to the complexity of agent models it is also difficult to validate the model
% against the observaions.
% 
% However, it is not straight forward to establish the CNHS by simplying blending
% differents models together. Rather, to achieve the effective modelling of CNHS
% requires one to solving series of questions (e.g. validation, scale issue, )
% 
% co-evolutional socio-hydrology is concerned with developing a mechanistic
% understanding of how the hydrological system and human society change over time
% due to feedbacks with each other. To address the co-evolution of systems,
% structural evolution and coupling between multiples processes at long timescales
% must be explicitly addressed. This will require that new connections are made
% between hydrology and other earth surface, biological and social disciplines.
% However, given the fact that both hydrological system and human society are
% complex and heterogeneous, it would be desirable to find a way that, on one
% hand, it is capable of handling autonomously acting agents as well as taking
% spatial and local aspects into account, and, on the other hand, it is able to
% constraint the complexity of the entire system. In this context, we define the
% framework of co-evolutional socio-hydrology study into the following blocks: 1)
% \textbf{General Modeling Framework}; 2) \textbf{Natural Process Component}; 3)
% \textbf{Behavioral Model}; 4) \textbf{Modeling Time Step}; 5) \textbf{Behavioral
% Parameterization}; 6) \textbf{Calibration and Validation Techniques}.
% 
% \textbf{General Modeling Framework} concerns on how to articulate social systems
% with hydrological systems. Historically, human alterations to the water cycle
% are treated as an external drivers whose impacts is unilateral, but it is well
% known that human intervention to the environment is not only dynamic but also
% bilateral. In fact, co-evolutionary socio-hydrology tends to treat both socio
% system and hydrologic system as endogenous component with respect to each other,
% and coupling them two is critical to evaluate the systematic changes due to
% co-evolution process. A good starting point can be Cellular Automata (CA)
% approach. In CA, each cell exists in one of a finite set of states, and future
% states depend on transition rules based on a local spatiotemporal neighborhood.
% The system is homogeneous in the sense that the set of possible states is the
% same for each cell and the same transition rule applies to each cell.
% \citealt{Balmann2009} presents a general cellular automata (CA) model framework
% to investigate whether structural change in an agricultural region is path
% dependent. The model involves a number of individually acting farms, as
% representatives of farmers, located at different points in an agricultural
% region and they try to optimize their activities with respect to their objective
% function by considering their expectations, financial state and existing assets.
% % All in all the individual decisions are based on objectives and expectations,
% % as well as on technical and economic restrictions.
% Although CA approach inductively assumes that the actions of human agents are
% important, in many cases it does not expressly model the human's
% decision-making. Others try to improve the model by explicitly positing a set of
% agents coincident with lattice cells and using transition rules as proxies to
% decision making. This encourages people to split the agent from the CA framework
% and model it explicitly. Human component is crucial in co-evolutionary
% socio-hydrology, and in nature, they are nothing but intelligent agents who have
% control over their actions and internal state in order to achieve goals.
% Specifically, they are autonomous, they share an environment through agent
% communication and interaction, and they make decisions that tie behavior to the
% environment.
% Therefore, the desire for inheriting the CA modeling framework while giving more
% credits on the agent concept and the decision-making process brings the
% Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) into people's view. MAS features a dynamic, spatial
% simulation-like model that consists of two components. The first is a cellular
% model that represents bio-geophysical and ecological aspects of a modeled
% system. The second is an agent-based model to represent human decision making.
% The cellular model is part of the agents' environment, and the agents in turn
% act on the simulated environment \citep[e.g.][]{Bousquet2004, citeulike:233804}.
% 
% Under the general framework such as MASs, \textbf{Natural Process Component} and
% \textbf{Agent} are two fundamental building blocks that constitute the social
% and environment systems, respectively. Elaboration of these components is
% necessary to facilitate the simulations and embody the co-evolutionary process
% correctly. As for the \textbf{Natural Process Component}, it is the carrier of
% hydrological variables (e.g. ground water flow, surface runoff,
% evaporation/transpiration) and physic-chemical matters (nutrient, pesticides,
% etc.), as well as the medium with which human interacts. For example,
% agriculture land is such natural component which is constantly being impacted
% through the farming practice, such as irrigation and fertilizing. Changing in
% the soil moisture and fertility greatly determines the state of crop growth,
% which in turn influence the yields and consequently, farmers' income.
% In MAS, the natural process component is represented by the cellular model which
% is usually drew on the spatial distributed bio-physical models, such as
% distributed rainfall-runoff models. It serves to simulate the dynamic involution
% of environment and provides the information for decision-making process of
% agents. Spatial resolution of those components is important in the sense that
% improper size of cell may fail to capture the variability of the constraints in
% space and time, resulting into unrealistic decision from simulation of agents'
% behavior.
% For example, a region simulated by the model may appear to have an overall
% seasonal water supply, but if the water is unevenly distributed in this area or
% in time, there are some farmers who, in fact, are not guaranteed with sufficient
% water supply or access to water when they need it. From model computation point
% of view, however, increase of spatial resolution requires more intensive
% computation power. Therefore, a trade-off is necessary.
% 
% \textbf{Agents}, as another important constituent, represent social entities
% that interact with the environment through various perspectives. Their behaviors
% are typically characterized by their decision-making (cognition) process, i.e.
% agents act according to some model of cognition that links their autonomous
% goals to the environment through their behavior. The term cognition ranges in
% applicability to relatively simple stimulus-response decision making to the
% point where actors are proactive, take initiative, and have larger intentions.
% At a minimum, an autonomous agent needs strategies that allow it to react to
% changes in environment, given the importance of the environment to goals and
% actions.
% To underline these processes it is necessary to understand human's behavior
% under various circumstances. However, modeling human behavior is quite complex
% due to the high heterogeneity and uncertainties in human's cognition and
% decision making process. Behavioural (cognition) models allow the representation
% of these complex systems into a simplified framework in order to investigate a
% strand of the structural whole. Generally there are two approaches of
% approximating human behavior: \textbf{Explicit method} and \textbf{Implicit
% method}.
% Each method can further embrace four attributes: \textbf{Decision Criteria},
% \textbf{Model Typology}, \textbf{Decision Variables }and \textbf{Constraints}.
% Particularly, for implicit method, the decision criteria actually refer to the
% objective functions to be optimized.
% 
% In this first approach one explicitly model the human's decision (cognition)
% process, e.g. perception, judgment, experience, expectation and action. Usually
% this kind of models is derived from social-psychological or neuro-behavioral
% science built on the concept of bounded rationality. Decision makers follow
% relatively simple rules (also referred as condition-action, stimulus-response
% rules or if-then rules) that guide their decision-making process. The explicit
% behavioral model can be implemented in a tree-alike approach in which
% hierarchically interconnected branches constitute the cognation path followed by
% an agent. %(make a literature review as an example).
% Moreover, it is easy to validate this kind of decision-tree as in each branch
% one can simply check whether the decision maker do follow certain path or not,
% by interviewing target agents or/and expertise. However, constructing a decision
% tree is not a straightforward task, as the researcher needs to identify not only
% the most important decisions, but also in the correct sequence.
% \citealt{Ducrot2004a} proposed a multi-agent model prototype to represent the
% relationships between urbanization dynamics and land and water management in a
% peri-urban catchment area, where farmers' decision-making process is guided by a
% series of ``rules''.
% In this case two types of agents are involved which are farmers and land owners.
% Farmers make decisions about which crop to grow while the urban owners decide
% their investment strategy on land (plot), and at same time they compete for the
% use of unoccupied plots. However, agents' decisions are constrained by their
% capacity, e.g. land owners with low capital available might not able to develop
% tourism within their domain.
% In \textbf{Implicit modeling}, which is originated from behavioral economic
% theory, agents are full rational and economic initiative. Decision-makers are
% represented as a computational agent who is able to reason his/her objective
% function and do the calculations, assuming a full possess of information needed.
% Then agents are able to select the best decision from a range of feasible
% alternatives while the selection process itself is assumed to be costless in
% terms of computation, i.e. the cognation process is somehow negligible and
% agents are highly motivated by their goal.
% The objective function can be total income or total profit, and usually
% interpreted as a linear function, with a series of constraints indicating the
% limited ability of the decision-maker in terms of resource and information.
% Therefore, inefficient decisions are ascribed to the infrastructural defect,
% such as the lack of accessibility of crop price in the market due to the failure
% of information sharing or illustration provided by government. Although the
% hypothesis of rational decision maker is less realistic and might even
% contradictory to real observations, it simplifies the problem and is useful for
% optimization problem.
% \citealt{Schreinemachers2011a} developed a high-complex agent-based simulation
% model to understand how various external drivers affect a heterogeneous
% population of farm households and the agro-ecological resources these households
% command. The model involves different optional modules that enable spatial
% interactions and social interactions without sacrifice to the heterogeneity of
% agent and landscape. Farmers are divided into hierarchical classes, having
% different phases of decision-making process, i.e. investment, production and
% consumption. Emergence of innovations depends on population cluster level, i.e.
% high population cluster level would indicate a better information exchange thus
% a higher probability of adopting new innovations.
% Farmers adapt their resource use in response to changes in the relate scarcity
% of these resources as affected by policies, climate, technologies, and markets,
% while at the same time, they make expectation about crop yields, water supply
% and market prices based on past experience. The articulation between agents and
% environment are realized through the crop production module, as the crop yield
% depends on the environmental condition, e.g. soil fertility or water supply from
% stream flow, as well as farmers' decision, e.g., irrigation techniques,
% fertilizer load. At the core of the model is the Mathematical Programming (MP)
% that simulates the actual decision-making of individual farm households, who are
% repeatedly solving a constrained optimization problem with respect to their
% objectives. The model is applied to several case studies and proved to be of
% great strength and flexibility, since it embraces various modules and allows
% capturing much economic and environmental heterogeneity among agents.
% 
% However, the domains between explicit and implicit models are not exclusive to
% each other. In fact, we expect a third form that lies between the explicit model
% and implicit one, which we would call it \textbf{Hybrid Form}. As have seen that
% the bifurcation of two behavioral models lies on the belief that whether human
% is full rational or not, a hybrid form can stay in between. It could draw on the
% advantage of implicit form, which is easy for calibration and useful for
% quantitative evaluation, but at same time assimilate the knowledge derived from
% explicit method, such as behavioral strategies or parameters, as the framework
% of behavioral model or as constraints to bound the objective function.
% \citealt{Becu2003} adopted a multi-agent system to simulate a small catchment
% water management in northern Thailand. The modeling framework in that paper
% involves biophysical modules for simulating the hydrological system with its
% distributed water balance, irrigation scheme management and crop and vegetation
% dynamics, while the social dynamics are described as a set of resource
% management processes (water, land, cash, and labor force).
% A majority of agents represent farmers in the region, while a small number of
% special agents are defined as a water manager who controls the release of weir
% for irrigation. In this paper, the author uses a mixture application of both
% implicit and explicit method to model agents' behaviors. Specifically, farmers'
% decision criteria is to maximize the profit by choosing the most profitable crop
% and other series of investment alternatives, using implicit optimization
% approach, while Managers decide the diversion of water supply to the canals
% according to the water expectation level and ratio between upstream and
% downstream water shortage, which is more explicit alike.
% 
% Interactions not only occur between agents and environment but also among agents
% themselves. Interaction amongst agents can be classified into two types:
% \textbf{Direct interaction }and \textbf{Indirect interaction}. Direction
% interaction refers to the case in which the agent is aware of other's situation,
% and can interact with neighbours by means of information exchange or duplication
% of other's behavior. One typical example is the diffusion of agriculture
% techniques. When an innovative agriculture technique becomes available, only a
% portion of farmer may decide to adopt such technique in their farming practice.
% More often those volunteers are farmers who are close to the origin of
% information and therefore are earlier to be informed by the availability of new
% techniques, or are farmers characterized as bold behavioral agents who are risk
% affine and would like to take adventure for the potential gain.
% By observing the consequence of antecedent decisions, other neighboring farmers
% then obtain such information and would try to adopt new method if they consider
% it beneficial for their own purpose, or avoid it otherwise.\citealt{Ng2011}
% applied an agent-based hydrologic-agronomic model (SWAT) with optimizing agent
% behavior to quantify the water quality impact due to farmers' choice on bio-fuel
% crops. Given the fact that farming bio-fuel crops is relatively new practice,
% not all farmers are aware of that and would like to convert their traditional
% crops into the new one. The paper described a process that the risk-averse
% farmers would only obtain the information of new bio-crops (e.g. price,
% productivity, etc.) once they have observed their neighbors' results.
% 
% \textbf{Indirect interaction} can be obscure but significant, because of the
% issue of contradiction between local optimum and global optimum. More
% specifically, in this case each agent pursues their maximum utility according to
% the assumption of economic rationality, while chasing the local optimum may turn
% out to hamper the achievement of global maximum. Take the use of nutrient
% fertilizer as an example. Under the constraint on nutrient fertilizer
% application for the sake of environmental protection, one moment of reflection
% can reveal that the increased use of fertilizer by one farmer would inevitably
% undermine other's opportunity in using nutrient fertilizer.
% As a consequence, one might maximize the objective function for certain group of
% agents, but with the sacrifice to the loss of all remaining ones. Completing for
% land resource is another typical example. \citealt{Schreinemachers2011a}
% developed a high-complex agent-based simulation model to understand how various
% external drivers affect a heterogeneous population of farm households and the
% agro-ecological resources these households command. The model involves different
% optional modules that enable spatial interactions and social interactions
% without sacrifice to the heterogeneity of agent and landscape.
% One component of social interactions described in this paper is the transaction
% of available land plots and water rights, which is modeled as a simple auction
% mechanism taking into account the internal transportation cost, i.e. each agent
% bids for that plot and would acquire it if its bid out compete others. Although
% the author did not explicit comment on such interaction as indirect, one can
% easily figure out that in this case there exists a tradeoff between the local
% farmer's profit and global welfare.
% 
% \textbf{Behavioral Parameterization} is another important issue which in
% principle should be done before any particular behavioral modeling approach
% being selected. As the implementation of human decision-making processes is
% critical to reflect agents' behavior and properly incorporate the impacts human
% interactions have, the agent attributes and behavioral response functions that
% represent these processes require knowledge support from qualitative and/or
% quantitative empirical sources.
% By parameterizing targeted agents' behavior, one can not only gain the knowledge
% on agents' behavioral strategy, but can also identify the agent typology which
% is helpful to simplify the problem. Alex \citealt{Smajgl2011} proposed a
% framework for parameterizing the human behavior. As suggested by
% \citealt{Smajgl2011}, two fundamental steps involves in conceptualizing the
% human behavioral model: 1) the development of behavioral categories; and 2) the
% scaling to the whole population of agents. The second step is nothing but about
% assigning the parameters derived from samples to target population, while the
% first one is more methodological which concerns on the procedures of
% conceptualizing the behavioral parameters based on the samples. Specifically,
% the parameterization framework of agent behavior can be identified as a
% three-stage procedure:
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Identify different classes of agents \item Specify the values for agent
% attributes or the parameters for the behavioral rules agents follow, in order to
% develop the typology of different agent within same class \item Up- or
% down-scale the parameters into the whole population.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Distinctive agent classes, such as farmers with respect to urban regulators, can
% be distinguished and categorized according to expert's knowledge, participant
% observation, interviews, etc. Then, within each class, sub-classes can be
% further introduced by identifying agents with the same behaviors and similar or
% identical parameters of behavior. Sub-class can be specified based on agent
% attributes (e.g., age, capital) or from data on agent behaviors derived from
% same techniques mentioned above. After complete the parameterization of samples,
% one have to assign the results to the whole population by means of proportional
% up- or down-scaling, or by Monte Carlo approach if representativeness of the
% samples cannot be assumed.
% 
% \textbf{Modeling Time Step} is crucial due to the intrinsic difference in the
% frequency between the natural process and human decision-making. Usually natural
% process requires a finer temporal resolution from hours to daily for simulating
% the hydrological process, while human's decision is taken on a longer time lag.
% One simple example is the farmers' choice of crop which is often made annually.
% Therefore, there exists a discrepancy between two systems and requires
% coordination. In general, the global modeling time step is dominated by the
% longest time step required. More specifically, the decision-making process often
% requires the information on larger time scale, which can be obtained by simply
% aggregating piecemeal information step by steps. In \citealt{Maneta2009} paper,
% the hydrological model is run on daily step and the economic model is simulated
% on monthly scale.
% 
% \textbf{Calibration} and \textbf{Validation} of such coupled socio-hydrological
% system can be always investigated in two aspects, both for the natural process
% component and for agents' behaviors. Regarding to natural system, one can refer
% to the traditional techniques of model calibration, such as using field measured
% data. Validation concerns how well model outcomes represent real system
% behavior.
% Validation therefore involves comparing model outputs with real-word
% observations or the product of another model or theory assumed to adequately
% characterized reality. Outcomes of interest may be demographic, such as
% aggregated spatial distribution of population or migration, patterns and degree
% of natural resource exploitation, spatial pattern of land cover. For example,
% one can use remote sensing images of land use to check the truthfulness of
% simulated scenarios. Monte Carlo run and sensitivity analysis are other
% alternatives to assess the robustness of the model. When the object is the
% agents' behaviors, things become much more complex. As we mentioned before in
% conceptualization of human behaviors, the behavioral parameters can be obtained
% directly using experts' knowledge, social survey, and questionnaires and so on.
% Mathematical Programming (MP) is another popular method for calibrating
% behavioral parameters in objective functions, particularly useful for implicit
% method.
% The inherent nonlinearity and enormity of possible human behavior responses
% represents extremely complex challenges for the validation of human behavior
% model. The technology for validating behavioral model includes the current
% capabilities for verifying, validating, evaluating and testing, as well as
% knowledge-based systems. Particularly, the validation can be performed at
% different level such as domain correspondence, physiological correspondence, or
% psychological correspondence. Validation against multiple levels would be
% favored to better confirm the behavioral model, but would greatly increase the
% amount of work required. Validating data source can be the human behavioral
% data, validated theory or experts' judgment.

\section{Behavioral modelling}\label{sec:intro_behaModel}

The impact of human societies on the natural system is mainly through the
anthropogenic activities, in which people make decisions on how to react to
external conditions towards certain goal. On a minimal level such
decision could be, e.g. the choice of whether save water or use more water for joy, while
on the other cases the decision may be more critical and influential, such as
the decision of constructing nuclear power plant or hydroelectric reservoir.
Therefore understanding how human behaves will provide precious insights and
serve as foundations for conceptualizing the behavioral models, which in
turn is the key to build an effective and reliable CHNS model. 

Modeling human behavior, however, is rather a non-trivial task. Human behavior
is well recognized as a complex non-linear multi-variate process due to the high
heterogeneity and uncertainties in human cognition and decision making process
\citep[e.g.,][]{george2008new,gluck2006modeling}.
By nature human are nothing but intelligent entities who have control over
their actions and internal states in order to achieve goals.
In psychological literature, human behaviors are under the control of
motivation, while motivation comes from need. From the motivation based
behavioral mechanism it has developed diverse theories, noticeably in the
studies of cognitive science \citep[e.g.,][]{bobrow2014representation,
miller2003cognitive} and behavioral decision-making \citep{simon1959theories}.
This section will review some critical aspects of the behavioral modeling in the
literature.

\subsection{Descriptive versus normative}

Countless attempts in modeling humans' have long been given in isolated fileds,
particularly in cognitive science and behavioral economics, but in general those
approaches can be categorized into two broad paradigms, namely descriptive
method or normative one. In the first case, descriptive modeling of human
behavior strives on describing and explaining the mechanism of how humans make
choices. Studies as such can mostly be found in many cognitive science
literature, which investigates the mental structure and information process in
the brain, seeking to understand the mechanism of how human thinks and reasons.
Theories developed so far has involved into a number of Human Behavioral
Representation (HBR) models \citep{mavor1998modeling}, such as the health belief
model (HBM) \citep{rosenstock1988social}, social-cognitive theory (SCT)
\citep{bandura2001social}, theories of reasoned action (TRA)
\citep{fishbein1975belief} and planned behavior (TPB) \citep{Netemeyer1991}, and
the protection motivation theory (PMT) \citep{rogers1975protection}.
Applications can be found largely in the health education and promotion studies,
where researchers adopt HBR to ensure the adherence of medical treatment of
patients. It is also worth mentioning that artificial intelligence was derived
from this field \citep{mccarthy2006proposal}.

On the other hand, the classic normative approach does not concern on the
internal states of the decision makers, but focuses on providing the guidance 
 to lead them towards the `optimal' solutions. The normative paradigm is
frequently seen in the behavioral economic and engineering field, where the idea
is to find the best alternative for improving the performance of the target
under investigation.
It is built on the assumption of rational decision maker, whose decision-making
process is goal oriented and seeks on attaining optimal solution in order to
maximize (minimize) some explicit or measurable criterion. Typically the utility function
is used for providing such measures, where people use it to rank the preference
of different alternatives. In other word, the decision-making process in this
case is intrinsically an optimization problem. Variations from this discipline
includes multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA, see \cite{zionts1979mcdm}), in which
decision-maker is facing many objectives and has to make a tradeoff, and Game
Theory \citep{von2007theory} where interactive decisions may take place among
multiple decision makers.

Apart from its popularity, the normative paradigm constantly suffers from the
critics about rational agent assumption, which is often contradicted with
reality as humans' behaviors might not be entirely rational
\citep[e.g.,][]{baron1998judgment,nickerson1998confirmation}.
Such rational agent assumption, however, can be relaxed by assuming different types of rationalities, e.g.
bounded rationality in which decision maker has incomplete access of information
and hence results into suboptimal decision \citep{simon1957models}.
Other people defend the full rationality as the consequence of natural
evolution, as only rational actors can survive during the natural selection
\citep{capra2011rationality}. Although the rationality assumption is somehow
debatable, what can not be reduced in the assumption is the functional behavior
formulation which connect the means to the end. 
% This again may counter-interact
% with real cases where `optima' decisions do not imply their rationality, e.g., a
% paranoid criminal.

Despite the large applications of both paradigms, it is difficult to say one is
superior than the other. On one hand, the descriptive representation of human
behavior is more intuitive. Many HBR models require observed samples for model
calibration, and hence is in principle more close to reality and also easy to be
validated.
However, given the high heterogeneity of sample data it is often impossible to
parametrize the model for each individual nor can it be generalized to develop
common knowledge. Moreover, application of descriptive behavioral model in
current studies implies the limited predictive skill even with state-of-art
approach.
On the other hand, the normative paradigm is less context dependent. If one can
accept the rationality assumption, there are well-defined axioms for
constructing the utility and formulating the problem. And there are numbers of
algorithm available for searching possible alternatives and solving such
optimization problem, e.g. dynamic programming, evolutionary algorithm, etc.
Nevertheless, one has to pay attention to the formulation of the behavioral
optimization problems, particularly the objective function, because tradeoff
persists under many objectives or even within a single objective problem but
considering short-run or/and long-run strategies. In addition, it is difficult
to identify all possible alternatives leading to suboptimal performance.
One may consider the outcome from normative formation of behavior models as an
equilibrium state and postulates that the actor will eventually behave in an
optimal way, which also give the normative approach somewhat the predictive
capacity, while the descriptive one can be described as an explicit approach in
explaining the internal state transitions before the equilibrium state is
reached. Therefore, the choice between the two paradigms depends on the characteristic of the problems.

\subsection{Implicit modeling versus explicit approach}

The architecture of human behavioral models is reflective of the behavioral
paradigm, as was described in previous part.
From modeling perspective, there are two broad ways of approaching human
behavior, namely \textit{Explicit} method and \textit{Implicit} method (or
optimization based). 

As rooted in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, explicit models
usually take a structured design focusing on describing the procedures of how
human act to make a decision, characterized by an incomplete representations of
reality as analogous to the incapability of humans in capturing the world
accurately, and is highly dynamic as representative of humans' adaptive nature.
The Modeling frameworks can be grouped in the following three classes: $1$)
Decision-tree models or rule-set based models, where each non-leaf node
represents a triggering condition or operation, and leaf node represents the
behavioral decisions. $2$) Task network models in which the operator goals are
decomposed into their component tasks. Therefore, to achieve the final goal
requires the accomplishment of series of tasks. It is necessary to point out that in this case the
decision-making process concerns with how tasks are represented, and less
emphasis is put on the final outcome. In other word, the actor is interested in
the `rational' decisions (so called instrumental rationality, see
\cite{heidegger1954question}). to achieve the task rather than obtain the
optimal outcome.
Therefore, it cuts off the connection between the means to the ends, while the
latter in this case are rather an endogenous components of the model of the
environment. $3$) Cognitive models where mental states upon which
reasoning, decision making, and behavior are explored and constructed. It is considered as
most realistic framework for modeling humans' behavior, providing the cognitive
foundations for other framework, but the downsides are the high complexity and
intensive computation cost. 

In general, explicit models can be graphically represented as hierarchical
set of nodes and edges with links standing for the control flows, and decision
makers follow simple rules (also referred as condition-action, stimulus-response
rules or if-then rules) that guide their decision-making process. Apart from the
cognitive models, it is also relatively easy to validate these models as in each
branch one can simply check whether the decision maker do follow certain path or
not, by interviewing target or/and expertise. However, constructing a decision
tree is not a trivial task, as the researcher needs to identify not only the
most important behavioral factors, but also the correct sequence. Moreover, in
dealing with large number of entities, which may involve thousands of
decision-makers, it will be unfeasible to derive the behavioral
rules for all the targets considered.

% \citealt{Ducrot2004a} proposed a multi-agent model prototype to represent the
% relationships between urbanization dynamics and land and water management in a
% peri-urban catchment area, where farmers' decision-making process is guided by
% a series of ``rules''.
% In this case two types of agents are involved which are farmers and land
% owners.
% Farmers make decisions about which crop to grow while the urban owners decide
% their investment strategy on land (plot), and at same time they compete for
% the use of unoccupied plots. However, agents' decisions are constrained by
% their capacity, e.g. land owners with low capital available might not able to
% develop tourism within their domain.

In \textit{Implicit modeling}, decision-makers are assumed as fully rational and
very often economic initiative, represented as a computational agent who is able
to reason his/her utility function and do the math. Final decision is the one
that maximize the utility function, derived from a range of feasible
alternatives. The utility function can be monetary performance or other
risk-based indicator such as regret.
Different from the explicit approach, the implicit models focus on the best
outcome achievable from all possible alternatives, while pays less interest on
the explicit state transitions of reaching such results. In addition, the computation
engine incorporated in the behavioral model for solving optimization problems
postulates that the decision-makers have all information necessary for doing
complex math, and the computation cost is usually free or negligible. These
assumptions reflect the prescriptive nature, where the models provide means for
identifying the behavioral inefficacy components and guidance toward optimal
outcome. As was mentioned above, the normative paradigm depicts the equilibrium
state assuming the decision-maker will ultimately make the best choice given
sufficient resource and time. If the rational assumption can hold, then the
implicit model also acquires the predictive skill in describing what may occur
in long-run.

As deeply rooted in the normative paradigm, the implicit behavioral models are
also criticized for its strong assumptions, such as full rationality, super
computation capacity, and full information access. Many assumptions in fact can be
compromised by carefully identify the problem nature and adapt the models
accordingly. For example, the utility function can be constrained indicating the
limited ability of the decision-maker in terms of resource and information.
Therefore, inefficient decisions are ascribed to the infrastructural defect,
such as the lack of accessibility of crop price in the market due to the failure
of information sharing.


% \citealt{Schreinemachers2011a} developed a high-complex agent-based simulation
% model to understand how various external drivers affect a heterogeneous
% population of farm households and the agro-ecological resources these households
% command. The model involves different optional modules that enable spatial
% interactions and social interactions without sacrifice to the heterogeneity of
% agent and landscape. Farmers are divided into hierarchical classes, having
% different phases of decision-making process, i.e. investment, production and
% consumption. Emergence of innovations depends on population cluster level, i.e.
% high population cluster level would indicate a better information exchange thus
% a higher probability of adopting new innovations.
% Farmers adapt their resource use in response to changes in the relate scarcity
% of these resources as affected by policies, climate, technologies, and markets,
% while at the same time, they make expectation about crop yields, water supply
% and market prices based on past experience. The articulation between agents and
% environment are realized through the crop production module, as the crop yield
% depends on the environmental condition, e.g. soil fertility or water supply from
% stream flow, as well as farmers' decision, e.g., irrigation techniques,
% fertilizer load. At the core of the model is the Mathematical Programming (MP)
% that simulates the actual decision-making of individual farm households, who are
% repeatedly solving a constrained optimization problem with respect to their
% objectives. The model is applied to several case studies and proved to be of
% great strength and flexibility, since it embraces various modules and allows
% capturing much economic and environmental heterogeneity among agents.

Nevertheless, the domains between explicit and implicit models are yet exclusive to
each other, but rather a continuum in between. Therefore, it is expected a third
hybrid form, which could draw on the advantage of implicit form, as flexible and
content independent, but at same time assimilate the knowledge derived from
explicit method, such as behavioral strategies or parameters, as the framework
of behavioral model or as constraints to bound the objective function. 
% \citealt{Becu2003} adopted a multi-agent system to simulate a small catchment
% water management in northern Thailand. The modeling framework in that paper
% involves biophysical modules for simulating the hydrological system with its
% distributed water balance, irrigation scheme management and crop and vegetation
% dynamics, while the social dynamics are described as a set of resource
% management processes (water, land, cash, and labor force).
% A majority of agents represent farmers in the region, while a small number of
% special agents are defined as a water manager who controls the release of weir
% for irrigation. In this paper, the author uses a mixture application of both
% implicit and explicit method to model agents' behaviors. Specifically, farmers'
% decision criteria is to maximize the profit by choosing the most profitable crop
% and other series of investment alternatives, using implicit optimization
% approach, while Managers decide the diversion of water supply to the canals
% according to the water expectation level and ratio between upstream and
% downstream water shortage, which is more explicit alike.

% \subsection{Public majority versus individual behavior}
\subsection{Abstract agent versus real person}

The target entity of behavioral models does not necessarily take the form of
individual human beings, but may also be the organizations or
infrastructures where humans' decisions play the major role in their
functionalities, such as the association of farm households or the regulated
reservoir with central management committee. 
Therefore, modeling the behavioral entities can be approached at different
dimensions, ranging from large scale organizational  `agent' to micro scale real
actors. It is usually intuitive to justify the choice of such scale issue
according on the specific problems one is targeting. For instance, studies of
economics tend to apply behavioral models on the high abstraction level of
behavioral entities such as firms, or on governmental institutions, while
cognitive researches tend to be more interested in studying a individual
behaviors. 

However, by and large it is easier to conduct the behavioral modeling for the
high level-of-analysis than for a particular entity. On one hand, for the
normative paradigm rational assumption becomes more valid as those behavioral
entities generally are interested in maximizing the profit or social welfare,
and the utility functions can be well defined for solving optimization problem.
In addition, the prescriptive solutions feature the decision-aid for helping
such entities to overcome the inefficacy of current operation and move towards
more efficient one as long as they acquire sufficient resource, which is also
more predictable behavior. On the other hand, it is also more manageable for
explicit behavioral models to describe the decision-making process at
organizational level, since in such a way that the organizational operations
appears to be the key predictor for explaining the overall behavioral pattern
\citep{krueger2002entrepreneurship}. Instead, when the scope is narrowed down to
an individual decision-maker, the number of uncertainty factors in determining
the predictant behavior increases dramatically, and the possibility of deviating
from the rational performance is high \citep[e.g.,][]{baron1998judgment,
nickerson1998confirmation, tversky1974judgment}.

% It is usually intuitive to justify the choice of such scale issue
% according on the specific problems one is targeting, but the choice the
% modeling technique needs to be taken with caution.
% 
% For instance, studies of economics tend to apply behavioral models on the high
% abstraction level of behavioral entities such as firms, or on governmental
% institutions, but with distinctively purposeful use of the modeling techniques. 
% Many successful applications of normative behavioral paradigm can be found in
% the studies of microeconomics to inform the decision-makers with better
% alternatives \citep[e.g.,][]{}.
% In this case it is easy to validate the rational assumptions as those behavioral
% entities generally are interested in maximizing the profit or social welfare,
% and the utility functions can be well defined for solving optimization problem.
% In addition, the prescriptive solutions feature the decision-aid for helping
% such entities to overcome the inefficacy of current operation and move towards
% more efficient one as long as they acquire sufficient resource, which is also
% more predictable behavior.
% 
% On the other hand, there are also quite an amount of studies using the explicit
% models to 
% 
% There are also cases of using explicit models for large scale behavioral
% analysis. Under large scale analysis where each agent is modeled explicitly, the
% focus lies on differentiate heterogeneity among individual behaviors. Moreover,
% the social interactive behavior can be included as well. However, due to the
% high demand of calibration of parameters, exploring the behavior of each agent
% with descriptive method is not feasible. Instead, people tends to only identify
% representative behavioral model from a subset of samples and use it for group
% agents.
% 
% In general, the complexity (rationality) in modeling the behavior increases as
% the modeling entity becomes more specific, e.g., a man's cognitive
% process in making the decisions. Moreover, the assumption about full rationality
% is less obvious for a single actor who is often observed in
% making non-rational choice even there are advanced tools or information for
% supporting the rational choices. Intuitively, explicit models are more dedicated
% to this case in which one can describe the actual behavioral pattern in detail
% from observed (survey) data.

% Decision making theory focuses on the analysis of the individual behaviors
% facing aleatoric uncertain \citep{mccarthy2006proposal}, or in presence of a group of decision
% makers whose decisions may ultimately impact his/her choice \citep{game thoery}.
% In general, there are two distinctive decision-making paradigms, namely a
% normative and a descriptive one, respectively.  On the other hand, the
% behavioral decision theorists from descriptive paradigm share the overlap with
% normal cognitive science, where their focus lies on understanding how and why
% decision-making processes are operated as they do. The decision-making is
% context specific and can be described as solving a series of task with efficient
% ways without explicitly addressing the optimal value (so called instrumental
% rationality). In other word, it cuts of the relationship between the means to
% the end.

% \subsection{Multi-agent framework}

% =====================================
\section{Objective and organization of dissertation}

  The present thesis is essentially a part of overall picture concerning on the
  CHNS analysis. In this work, we developed an innovative decision-analytic
  framework based on the idea of CHNS and the behavioral models as the main
  contribution. We constructed a realistic model for a human regulated
  lake-agricultural system, in which different types of agents are actively
  adapting to the changing socio-environmental conditions by strategically
  interacting on the environment,  while at meantime receiving the feedbacks
  from the natural systems. In particular, we adopted the ABM framework embedded
  with implicit behavioral models to represent the decision-making process of
  agents, inspired from traditional normative decision-making analysis.
  Different from the previous studies where humans' behaviors are either lumped
  conceptually in the system or modeled with simple decision rules, the implicit
  models are built on the normative paradigm of decision analysis using
  optimization models and allows agents to self-organize their decisions that
  best suit for their own objectives without being constrained by pre-defined
  behavioral structure.
  Interactions among different agents also be included by cross-conditioning
  ones' decisions to the other.

  The proposed CHNS model offers a unique framework to simulate different
  adaptation options under changing boundary conditions, namely hydro-climatic
  drivers or socio-techno-economic forcings. In addition, it allows one to
  explore the tentative pictures of human-water system resulting from
  co-evolutionary process, based on which prescriptive solutions can be
  identified for improving the system's performance under uncertain future
  scenarios. The potential of the CHNS model is demonstrated through a series of
  concrete applications on the Adda River basin located in North Italy, where
  the presence of humans' signatures are dominant, and the system has
  been undergoing rapid changes in recent decades possibly due to the
  dual-affect of climate change impact and local human activities. We show how
  the traditional optimization based decision-making analysis embedded in the
  CHNS model can be used to diagnosis the complex human-natural system under
  changing conditions, and to search for the potential adaptation measures to
  alleviate the negative affects.

  Since the same study area is used across the entire dissertation, in the following
  chapters Chapter \ref{ch:study_site} will first provides a full description
  about the pilot study region located in North Italy, namely the Adda River 
  water systems, on which the proposed decision-analytic framework was constructed
  and examined. In Chapter \ref{ch:distrilake}, the author will explain the
  proposed CHNS models built with different components, namely the physical
  environment and biological processes, as well as the agents' behavior.

  The first case study will be given in Chapter \ref{ch:coadaptation}, in
  which we discuss the value of proposed CHNS models first as a descriptive tool
  to diagnosis the performance of current system, and to assess the degradation
  of it under future projections given more extreme hydro-climatic conditions.
  Then we explore the potential of strategical interactions (co-adaptation)
  between the authoritative decision-maker and active stakeholders as a way to
  break the current rigid policy design and move towards more timely and
  flexible structure. We show in our results how the co-adaptation approaches
  can substantially improve the systems' performance under drought conditions
  without introducing any new engineering solutions.

  Chapter \ref{ch:robustness} extends the idea of co-adaptation approach, but
  weaves the story with deep uncertainty \citep{lempert2003shaping} in which the
  focus lays on assessing the vulnerability of current systems using sensitivity
  analysis, assuming the uncertainty of the hydro-climatic drivers in the future
  will be much wider than they are now. In this work, the proposed
  decision-analytic framework allows us to perform multi-level analysis of
  systems' robustness, and to explore the adaptive strategies for improvement.
  We show how the asymmetry of robustness may emerge when the robust criterion
  is defined at system's level and stakeholders' level, respectively. We also
  demonstrate the co-benefit from the strategic interaction between
  the authoritative decision-maker and the active stakeholders in improving the,
  highlighting the necessity and potential from timely co-adaptation in facing
  the deep uncertain future.

  In Chapter \ref{ch:weatherforecast}, we test the application of CHNS
  models as an alternative assessment framework for investigating the value of
  long-term climate forecast at end-use perspectives. We focus on examining
  the relationship between the forecast accuracies, as the traditional skill
  measures, and the operational value of them for supporting actual decisions
  of users of interest in terms of improving their economical performance or
  productions. Our results highlight that the ordinal ranks of forecast skills
  may not be consistent with their operational potentials. Although some
  products do perform better than others in the simulations, there are no
  conclusive evidence to support the superiority between the institutional
